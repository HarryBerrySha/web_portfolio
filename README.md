# My Web Portfolio
This is my web portfolio I made to demonstrate understanding of the frontend of websites. 

**Link to website:** https://harryberrysha.github.io/web_portfolio/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jekyll

This is just a demonstration of what I know how to do as well as a hub for others to see what I have worked on!

## What I Learned:

I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through this project. It was helpful as well as fun to organize and decorate the elements using CSS. It was also cool to learn what really goes into building the billions of websites on the internet.
